## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
What a caching system is

What FIFO means

What LIFO means

What LRU means

What MRU means

What LFU means

What the purpose of a caching system

What limits a caching system have
## Requirements
### Python Scripts
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7)

All your files should end with a new line

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env python3

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

Your code should use the pycodestyle style (version 2.5)

All your files must be executable

The length of your files will be tested using wc

All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(/_/_import/_/_("my_module")./_/_doc/_/_)')

All your classes should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(/_/_import/_/_("my_module").MyClass./_/_doc/_/_)')

All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(/_/_import/_/_("my_module").my_function./_/_doc/_/_)' and python3 -c 'print(/_/_import/_/_("my_module").MyClass.my_function./_/_doc/_/_)')

A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
